I have always been a fitness enthusiast, have always loved devouring publications, research articles and journals on nutrition science. I soon realised that my real passion and interest lies in fitness and allied services. I have been working in this field since 2014, have engaged with a large number of clients and have helped them meet their goals.\n\nI believe, nothing is greek and latin, apart from greek and latin - ofcourse! ;) Fitness as a lifestyle is fairly simple, if you understand the fundamentals right! Your fitness goal, is a journey and in this journey it is important to take one step at a time. I strongly believe in flexibility and sustainability in ones fitness regime, for it to be long term in nature. Fitness, after all, should be a lifelong pursuit!",
